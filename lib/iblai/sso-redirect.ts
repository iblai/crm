/**
 * Decide the post-SSO landing path.

 * An explicit `?redirect-path=` wins over the path SsoLogin resolved from

 * path (one leading slash, no `//` or `/\` authority), or the landing is `/`
 * — both inputs reach this page from the URL, so either could be an open
 * redirect. Finally, a path scoped to `/platform/<org>` for an org other than
 * the one just authenticated is stale — reset to `/`, which resolves the
 * session's org.
